- 👋 Hi, I’m @esmith8
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, data analysis, and econometrics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to survive CS in CS 3100 and CS 3140. My ultimate goal is to go into statistics but I can't until I get out of the Engineering School.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can help with.
